It is the state-of-the-art global wireless standard that enables an advanced kind of network designed to connect virtually everyone and everything with increased speed and reduced latency. Therefore, its development, analysis, and security are critical. However, all approaches to the 5G protocol development and security analysis, e.g., property extraction, protocol summarization, and semantic analysis of the protocol specifications and implementations are completely manual. To reduce such manual effort,foundation model are used to summarize the paragraphs automitically. The dataset that is used in this notebook has two columns which are paragraph and simplification(summary).\n","\n","\n","\n","## Contents\n","\n","This notebook contains the following parts:\n","\n","- [Setup](#setup)\n","- [Data loading](#data)\n","- [Foundation Models on watsonx](#models)\n","- [Model testing](#predict)\n","- [Score](#score)\n","- [Summary](#summary)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"},"id":"D3Ds4le9pcMS"},"source":["<a id=\"setup\"></a>\n","##  Set up the environment\n","\n","Before you use the sample code in this notebook, you must perform the following setup tasks:\n","\n","-  Create a <a href=\"https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/ibm-watson-machine-learning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener no referrer\">Watson Machine Learning (WML) Service</a> instance (a free plan is offered and information about how to create the instance can be found <a href=\"https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-service-instance.html?context=analytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener no referrer\">here</a>).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"},"id":"x4ygXINBpcMS"},"source":["### Install and import the `datasets` and dependecies"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Eae5AxPipcMS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708938196856,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":53421,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Sunder Naik","userId":"02055479827278342688"}},"outputId":"76917be3-23e2-49d1-cb13-ef9a59317131"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Successfully installed datasets-2.17.1 dill-0.3.8 multiprocess-0.70.16\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests) (2024.2.2)\n","Successfully installed wget-3.2\n","Successfully installed PyJWT-2.8.0 ibm-cloud-sdk-core-3.19.1 urllib3-2.2.1\n","Successfully installed rouge-1.0.1\n"]}],"source":["!pip install datasets | tail -n 1\n","!pip install requests | tail -n 1\n","!pip install wget | tail -n 1\n","!pip install ibm-cloud-sdk-core | tail -n 1\n","!pip install rouge | tail -n 1"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"id":"BG_MBKHYpcMT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708938489859,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2695,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Sunder Naik","userId":"02055479827278342688"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import os, getpass, wget\n","import requests\n","from datasets import load_dataset\n","from ibm_cloud_sdk_core import IAMTokenManager\n","from ibm_cloud_sdk_core.authenticators import IAMAuthenticator, BearerTokenAuthenticator\n","from pandas import value_counts, read_csv, DataFrame\n","from rouge import Rouge\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Qy-ZiaippcMT"},"source":["### Inferencing class\n","This cell defines a class that makes a REST API call to the watsonx Foundation Model\n","inferencing API that we will use to generate output from the provided input.\n","The class takes the access token created in the previous step, and uses it to\n","make a REST API call with input, model id and model parameters.
