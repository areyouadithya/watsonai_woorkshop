Tip for success: If you select varieties that are resistant to disease and pests, growing tomatoes can be quite easy. For experienced gardeners looking for a challenge, there are endless heirloom and specialty varieties to cultivate. Tomato plants come in a range of sizes. There are varieties that stay very small, less than 12 inches, and grow well in a pot or hanging basket on a balcony or patio. Some grow into bushes that are a few feet high and wide, and can be grown is larger containers. Other varieties grow into huge bushes that are several feet wide and high in a planter or garden bed. Still other varieties grow as long vines, six feet or more, and love to climb trellises. Tomato plants do best in full sun. You need to water tomatoes deeply and often. Using mulch prevents soil-borne disease from splashing up onto the fruit when you water. Pruning suckers and even pinching the tips will encourage the plant to put all its energy into producing fruit.\n","###\n","\n","Question: Is growing tomatoes easy?\n","Answer: Yes, if you select varieties that are resistant to disease and pests.\n","\n","Question: What varieties of tomatoes are there?\n","Answer: There are endless heirloom and specialty varieties.\n","\"\"\"\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ghNbQXuOkl5s"},"source":["Prepare question for the model."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"25MZIx1Nkl5s","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708936920764,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":435,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Sunder Naik","userId":"02055479827278342688"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["question = \"Question: Why should you use mulch when growing tomatoes?\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DmltNwWSkl5t"},"source":["### Answer the question using Meta `llama-2-70b-chat` model.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"be8TJzJYkl5t"},"source":["Inter the model to answer the question, according to provided instruction."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"id":"H6WiC-O3kl5t","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708936925071,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1655,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Sunder Naik","userId":"02055479827278342688"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["result = model.generate_text(\" \".join([instruction, question]))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"70-owo3ukl5t"},"source":["Explore model output."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"CzH0vZBlkl5t","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708936927330,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":419,"user":{"displayName":"Anjali Sunder Naik","userId":"02055479827278342688"}},"outputId":"15b2c914-3b84-4d5b-da15-efcc61b5d953"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","Answer: Using mulch prevents soil-borne disease from splashing up onto the fruit when you water.\n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["print(result)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"},"id":"u-ofHa5Akl5t"},"source":["<a id=\"summary\"></a>\n","## Summary and next steps\n","\n"," You successfully completed this notebook!.\n","\n"," You learned how to answer questions about body of text with Meta's `llama-2-70b-chat` on watsonx.\n","\n"," Check out our _<a href=\"https://ibm.github.io/watson-machine-learning-sdk/samples.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener no referrer\">Online Documentation</a>_ for more samples, tutorials, documentation, how-tos, and blog posts."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"},"id":"elnBS_IZkl5t"},"source":["### Authors\n","\n","**Daniel Ryszka**, watsonx.ai & Watson Machine Learning."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"},"id":"HWcc0w8Fkl5t"},"source":["Copyright © 2023 IBM.
